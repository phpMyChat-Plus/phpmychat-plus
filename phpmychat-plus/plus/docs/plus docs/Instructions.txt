Installation - short version.
Note: This version need a manual install. (not running the install.php as the bas version does)

1. Extract plus.zip
2. Edit these file:
a. config/config.lib.php - only the database details (first 3 lines at the begining of the file)
3. Upload the plus directory into your public_html folder.
Note: index.php must be in the plus folder, not plus/chat/ as for the previous versions.
The file index1.php is the index version with the full page filled. Choose the one you want and keep it as index.php.
4. Rename plus folder to whatever you'd like.
5. Change Attributes to 777 for these files/folders:
plus/acount/pages/chat_index.txt
plus/acount/pages/ip.txt
plus/bot/subs.inc
plus/botfb/
plus/logs/
plus/logsadmin/
6. Go to plus/installation/ folder on your drive and open mysql.sql file. Don't change any data there. You will be able to customize
your chat later, from the config page (Clicking Administration link on your index page)
7. Test your site functionality by opening http://yoururl.com/plus (plus is the name you used in step 4.) in your browser. Note that there is only one admin right now: admin, password admin.
8. Register your desired administrator name and change its permissions to 'admin' in c_reg_table table. Check if your new name has become indeed an admin.
9. Delete the admin user from the c_reg_users table
10. Open the Administration menu/link and customize your chat.
11. Rename your logsadmin folder on both admin config panel and ftp folder to a hardly to guess name.
That's it! It should fly!

Optional
If you want to use the bot follow these instructions:
1. Extract the aiml.zip archive into plus/bot/aiml folder.
2. Upload all the files into your ftp account - same folder.
3. Open your browser and type: http://yoursiteurl.com/plus/bot/boatloader.php
4. Wait for the loader to finish the import operation. At the end, you can test the bot following the instructions on the bottom of that page.
5. If it works from talk.htm (.php), it should work now in your chat as well.
6. To start the bot in a room, type: /bot start
7. To talk to the bot, just mention his name "plusbot" in a message (same room)
8. To shut the bot up type "bye plusbot"
9. To stop the bot and make him quit the room, type /bot stop in the room it's running into.
Note: If you don't intend to use the bot, edit the quick menu in admin config panel to eliminate the bot commands from the quick list.

This version comes only with the english language files.
Edit all the other languages you want but english and add them in chat/localization/.
Insert, modify and translate according to the new lines added in english version (use a text compare software).

That's all for now! Have a nice one and let me know how it goes!
