-/ghost command: put the user into a ghost state (the ghost user and his posts cannot be seen in the room, he won’t know about this, so he gives up and leave the chat - works when banning has no effect on a specific user; it also allows an admin/moder to go invisible in the chat); - second part is done for power users.

I want to allow permissions for certain rooms without them having to "sign in"  and keep people out of them that aren’t supposed to be there.  Is that possible? Say I want to make room three where only certain people can get in it, I don’t want them to have to have a special password, but just be approved for there.  It would be something I would have to "allow" as an admin.
Could we write a code in the styles, like "get permission" for a certain room? Where it would show up on the admin cp?
