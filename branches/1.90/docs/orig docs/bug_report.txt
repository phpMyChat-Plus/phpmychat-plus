 Reporting Bugs
----------------

To report bugs, either do it in the 'Bug Tracking System' of our
SourceForge account (http://phpmychat.sorceforge.net/), either fill the
form below and send it to our team address : phpheaven-team@yahoogroups.com

Please be as descriptive as possible. You may think it's something that
affects everyone, but many times it's specific to a browser or
operating system. So please be thorough. In the case of Bug Tracking,
there is *never* too much information or documentation or description.

Thanks for your help,

the phpHeaven-team
