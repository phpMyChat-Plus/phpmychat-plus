Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>
Most discussions of decision making assume that only senior executives make decisions or that only senior executives&#39; decisions matter. This is a dangerous mistake. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>

Suppliers and especially manufacturers have market power because they have information about a product or a service that the customer does not and cannot have, and does not need if he can trust the brand. This explains the profitability of brands. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>
Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of competence and performance. In teaching we rely on the "naturals," the ones who somehow know how to teach. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>
The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>

The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn&#39;t said. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>
The new information technology... Internet and e-mail... have practically eliminated the physical costs of communications. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Peter Drucker</i></font>

I also realized that the philosophers, far from ridding me of my vain doubts, only multiplied the doubts that tormented me and failed to remove any one of them. So I chose another guide and said, Let me follow the Inner Light; it will not lead me so far astray as others have done, or if it does it will be my own fault, and I shall not go so far wrong if I follow my own illusions as if I trusted to their deceits. <font color=778899><i>&sect; Jean Jacques Rousseau</i></font>
