How to Help Us?
"""""""""""""""

There are many ways in which you can help out in the development of
phpMyChat.

The first and best way you are already doing. You are using, or trying to use, it.

One of the keys to a great product is its users. Without users we can't
find bugs or get feedback on what's good and what sucks.

There are also certain areas that need improvement, especially databases.
... and English documentation authoring. :)

Lastly you can translate phpMyChat or complete/improve existing tanslations
(see translation.txt in the 'docs' dir).
