1Q.
After installing, I get this error:

1A.
This error is related to missconfig of your sql data in config/config.lib.php.
Make sure the database and username have a prefix like yourcpanelusername_name.

2Q.
How do I migrate my registered users from phpmychat standard c_reg_users table to plus?
2A.
The table name is the same. Just follow thiese steps:
1. Go to phpmyadmin and export your old c_reg_users table. Copy all the INSERT INTO lines to a text editor (I personally use UltraEdit32)
2. Add this code before this end of the line ); on each line containing user data:
, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', './images/avatars/def_avatar.gif'
(including the leading comma and ending ')
As an example, a line for a registered user to migrate to Plus will look like this:
Before addition:
INSERT INTO `c_reg_users` VALUES ('blabla', '', '47e014ee34869ded7e5236541246319d', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'WorldWideWeb', '', 'bla@...', '0', 'user', '', 1130763311, '80.96.72.233', '1');
(last '1' stands for gender of that user, so it might have '', '1' or '2' values)
After addition:
INSERT INTO `c_reg_users` VALUES ('blabla', '', '47e014ee34869ded7e5236541246319d', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'WorldWideWeb', '', 'bla@...', '0', 'user', '', 1130763311, '80.96.72.233', '1', 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', './images/avatars/def_avatar.gif');
3. Then copy all your new reg lines into plus/instalation/mysql.sql, in the according section of that file (there should be as many lines with INSERT INTO as your registered users number. If you migrate, you should delete the admin account line from mysql.sql, but let the plusbot account unaltered at this point!). It is also a good opportunity to promote your users to admin (just replace the value of desired user to be promoted, from 'moderator' or 'user' to 'admin')
4. Then follow the plus/docs/Instructions.txt

3Q.
The installation process is so complicated for me...
3A.
Well, my personal record time for a full instalation including upload of the new files, migration of the old users to Plus, fully adding the bot and addition of all the extrasounds for /buzz command is 28 minutes (the time between the user contacted me on Yahoo Messenger and the moment I said "All done!"); this hapenned on a brand new site for me (I also had to ask for cpanel details and so on, so the effective time consumed for installation was like 20 minutes). If you don't believe me, ask kay_s_ok@yahoo.com. She will confirm this.
So it is not actually too complicated, but requires some knowledge of mysql and ftp. How could an website admin have no clue about this? That's his problem, I guess...

4Q.
I run phpMyChat-Plus and I set up to have only a single public room. But there are some (0) 's displayed on my rooms list in the chat. How can I remove them?
4A.
If you personalize the rooms names and also the number of rooms, it is not enough to do it in the configuration tab of admin panel. It also requires a 2 lines editting in config/config.lib.php as follows:
Open config/config.lib.php and look for these lines:
$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM1, ROOM2, ROOM3, ROOM4, ROOM5);
$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM6, ROOM7, ROOM8, ROOM9);
This is the default layout and number of the rooms available in the chat.
Now, comment out the original lines and add the modified ones, as you like:
//$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM1, ROOM2, ROOM3, ROOM4, ROOM5);
//$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM6, ROOM7, ROOM8, ROOM9);
$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM1);
$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM2, ROOM3);
Please note that ROOM1 means it will use the skin number one, and so on. I would recommend you choose your desired skins first (visiting everyroom - public and private - if you already disabled them, use this testing server: http://plus.gamedogs.com and take a look at the styles used for each room). Then you use those corresponding numbers in the room definitions of your config.lib.php. For example, I will choose style 3 for the public room and 2 and 6 for the private rooms
$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM3);
$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM2, ROOM6);

5Q.
How do I avoid being booted from a chat after the time set for booting?
5A.
An admin and a moderator should never be booted. If that happens, it means your browser lost the connection with the server somehow.
For an user to stay logged even though he don't type for a while, he can go away using /away command (away users don't get booted)

6Q.
How can I totally disable the plusbot? I've already disabled it in the config menu but the name still appears in the chat room...
6A.
First - you need to go to Admin panel and re-enable it, then please go to the room he is in and use the command /bot stop.
Rule: Everytime you want to change a settings related to the bot (disable, name of the bot, font, avatar, aso), you need to stop it first in the room/rooms he is eventually running!
Bot has admin permissions therefore, if you don't follow the rule or forget about it, you won't be able to change/kick/remove the old running bot user from chat. So be careful.
If you did it already, go back to Admin panel and rename it back to the old name, then stop it then change the settings at your will.
6aQ.
How do I make my bot talk only private?
6aA.
Enable/Disable public conversations in Admin panel.

6Q.
How can I change the size of the differents frames of the room page? (i.e. size of banner.php, link.php, messages.php etc.)
6A.
All the sizes can be handled in lib/frameset_def.lib.php (not too much different from 0.14.5)
Basically:
a. the width of left and right sides is set by this line:
  <FRAMESET COLS="*,180" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
(180 stands for the width of the right side frames, * means the first frame takes the difference to 100% - measured in number of colons)

b. the heights of the right side frames are set by this line for IE and Firefox:
   <FRAMESET ROWS="80,*,40" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
or this line for the rest of the browsers (considered "of low capabilities "):
  <FRAMESET ROWS="80,*,50" BORDER=0>
(80 stands for exit frame, 40/50 stands for link frame and * for the users/rooms list - it represents the rest of the height of the page)

c. the height of the banner, messages and input frame requires more attention, as there are some conditions for the size to be displayed (if the bot is active or not - for the banner Bot tips row and, if the quick menu's are enabled or not - for the input Quick menu)
All these lines should be modified accordingly for IE and Firefox:
   <FRAMESET ROWS="38,*,60" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="25,*,60" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="38,*,35" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="25,*,35" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
or this line for the rest of the browsers (considered "of low capabilities "):
   <FRAMESET ROWS="38,*,55"BORDER="0">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="25,*,55"BORDER="0">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="38,*,35" BORDER="0">
   <FRAMESET ROWS="25,*,35"BORDER="0">
Explanation: the left numbers stand for the banner frame size, right ones for the input frame size and * is the rest of the page for the messages frame.
As an exemple, if I want to increase the size of the input frame, I would change 35 to 45 in all four lines where 35 appears (45 will be the new size of the frame when there is no Quick menu to be shown - the commands in the Admin Panel are empty) and, change 60 to 70 and 55 to 65 in all the lines they appear (for the Quick menu to be shown if defined).
Please note that for this last c. instructions, you need to keep the proportions accordigly (I increased with 10 lines the input frame in all 8 lines, no matter the conditions)

7Q.
How do I change the name of the Rooms in my phpmychat plus?
7A.
Only in Admin panel. Read it all to understand the power of the Configuration tab in the plus version...

8Q.
Whats happen here? On mozilla it's alright but not at the IE!
Warning: main(): Unable to access
./localization/ Deutsch/localize d.chat.php in
/home/www/web2/ html/plus/ lib/index. lib.php on line 69
Warning: main(./localization /Deutsch/ localized. chat.php) : failed to
open stream: No such file or directory in
/home/www/web2/ html/plus/ lib/index. lib.php on line 69
Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required
'./localization/ Deutsch/localize d.chat.php' (include_path= '.') in
/home/www/web2/ html/plus/ lib/index. lib.php on line 69
8A.
That's because the Deutch language isn't installed. It really shouldn't happen. I'll check on that for the next version...
The reason is: you have to delete the chat cookie after upgrade (clean the cookies). So tell that your users.
Quick solution: type in the address bar this url: http://yourwebsite/ plus/index. php?L=english (for the first time only)

9Q.
I cannot make any changes in the admin panel. It says it was successfully updated, but when I check back, nothing changed.
9A.
a. A reason could be if you use the ' character in a field, without commenting it out with a backslash \.
Example:
If a room name is called Men's Room, you have to comment it out with \' like this: Men\'s Room.
But I strongly recommend you avoid ussage of the ' or \ chars in your chat setting values.
b. There is something wrong in your database (c_config table) like the order of the fields or types/sizes of them.
c. You're using a wrong config/config.lib.php file - if you upgraded (make sure you replaced the old one with the new released one?)

10Q.
I use IE7 and Firefox 2.0 and I cannot see the messages in the status bar (Server time and such)
10A.
Yes, I noticed that as well. To see them just fine, I had to add my chat site to "Trusted sites" list in Tools/Internet Options/Security tab in IE;
Firefox 2.0 uses the latest Internet Explorer engine lately so it has to have such a setting somewhere, but I couldn't find it.
