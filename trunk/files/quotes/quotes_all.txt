Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of competence and performance. In teaching we rely on the "naturals," the ones who somehow know how to teach. <font color=778899><i>§ Peter Drucker</i></font>
The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself. <font color=778899><i>§ Peter Drucker</i></font>

The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer. <font color=778899><i>§ Peter Drucker</i></font>
There is an enormous number of managers who have retired on the job. <font color=778899><i>§ Peter Drucker</i></font>
There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all. <font color=778899><i>§ Peter Drucker</i></font>
Time is the scarcest resource and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed. <font color=778899><i>§ Peter Drucker</i></font>

Here’s how a tight group of online pioneers created a virtual neighbourhood which now transcends political, social, and economic strata. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
Human kindness, warmth, interaction, friendship, and family are far more important than anything that can come across my cathode-ray tube. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
I’ve got a half-dozen computers in my house. But this cult of computing gives me the heebie-jeebies. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
If you don’t have an E-mail address, you’re in the Netherworld. If you don’t have your own World Wide Web page, you’re a nobody. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
Merely that I have a World Wide Web page does not give me any power, any abilities, nor any status in the real world. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
Rather than bringing me closer to others, the time that I spend online isolates me from the most important people in my life, my family, my friends, my neighbourhood, my community. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
Spending an evening on the World Wide Web is much like sitting down to a dinner of Cheetos, two hours later your fingers are yellow and you’re no longer hungry, but you haven’t been nourished. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
The Internet is a telephone system that’s gotten uppity. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>

While I admire the insights of many of the people in the world of computing, I get this cold feeling that I speak a different language. <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
Why is it drug addicts and computer afficionados are both called users? <font color=778899><i>§ Clifford Stoll</i></font>
A subtle thought that is in error may yet give rise to fruitful inquiry that can establish truths of great value. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You’d be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
And above all things, never think that you’re not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
Creationists make it sound as though a ’theory’ is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>

From my close observation of writers... they fall into two groups: 1) those who bleed copiously and visibly at any bad review, and 2) those who bleed copiously and secretly at any bad review. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
He had read much, if one considers his long life; but his contemplation was much more than his reading. He was wont to say that if he had read as much as other men he should have known no more than other men. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
I am not a speed reader. I am a speed understander. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
I don’t believe in an afterlife, so I don’t have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
I don’t believe in personal immortality; the only way I expect to have some version of such a thing is through my books. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
I write for the same reason I breathe - because if I didn’t, I would die. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>

It is not only the living who are killed in war. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>

No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>

Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know - and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>

The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
To insult someone we call him "bestial". For deliberate cruelty and nature, "human" might be the greater insult. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
To introduce something altogether new would mean to begin all over, to become ignorant again, and to run the old, old risk of failing to learn. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>
Writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers. <font color=778899><i>§ Isaac Asimov</i></font>

The obscure we see eventually. The completely obvious, it seems, takes longer. <font color=778899><i>§ Edward R. Murrow</i></font>
We are all but recent leaves on the same old tree of life and if this life has adapted itself to new functions and conditions, it uses the same old basic principles over and over again.

Philosophers, for the most part, are constitutionally timid, and dislike the unexpected. Few of them would be genuinely happy as pirates or burglars. Accordingly they invent systems which make the future calculable, at least in its main outlines. <font color=778899><i>§ Bertrand Russell</i></font>
To teach how to live with uncertainty, yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy can do. <font color=778899><i>§ Bertrand Russell</i></font>

I was thrown out of college for cheating on the metaphysics exam: I looked into the soul of another boy. <font color=778899><i>§ Woody Allen</i></font>
I also realized that the philosophers, far from ridding me of my vain doubts, only multiplied the doubts that tormented me and failed to remove any one of them. So I chose another guide and said, Let me follow the Inner Light; it will not lead me so far astray as others have done, or if it does it will be my own fault, and I shall not go so far wrong if I follow my own illusions as if I trusted to their deceits. <font color=778899><i>§ Jean Jacques Rousseau</i></font>
The only difference between graffiti and philosophy is the word "fuck". <font color=778899><i>§ Author Unknown</i></font>
