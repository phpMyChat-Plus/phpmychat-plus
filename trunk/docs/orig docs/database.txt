The goal is not to help you setup your database for general use,
just how to setup the tables for phpMyChat.


Requirements
""""""""""""

phpMyChat currently supports 3 types of database :

  MySql
  PostgreSQL
  ODBC

MySql is the original database supported by phpMyChat and should at
all times (most likely) work for sure.

You will need to have your database preconfigured and working on
your system before you get to this stage. For help with this, please
consult your database specific help files.


Installation
""""""""""""

You will need to setup 3 tables.

The database name itself can be anything but the best name for it is
just 'phpmychat'.

The table names also can be changed; but by leaving them to what is
shown, you'll have one less step later on.

For those who want to change table names, you'll also need to change
the values for each within the 'chat/config/config.lib.php' file.

Table creation scripts are in the 'chat/install/databases' directory.
