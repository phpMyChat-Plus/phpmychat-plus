1A.
This error is related to missconfig of your sql data in config/config.lib.php.
Make sure the database and username have a prefix like yourcpanelusername_name.

2Q.
How do I migrate my registered users from phpmychat standard c_reg_users table to plus?
2A.
The table name is the same. Just follow thiese steps:
1. Go to phpmyadmin and export your old c_reg_users table. Copy all the INSERT INTO lines to a text editor (I personally use UltraEdit32)
2. Add this code before this end of the line ); on each line containing user data:
, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', './images/avatars/def_avatar.gif'
(including the leading comma and ending ')
As an example, a line for a registered user to migrate to Plus will look like this:
Before addition:
INSERT INTO `c_reg_users` VALUES ('blabla', '', '47e014ee34869ded7e5236541246319d', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'WorldWideWeb', '', 'bla@...', '0', 'user', '', 1130763311, '80.96.72.233', '1');
(last '1' stands for gender of that user, so it might have '', '1' or '2' values)
After addition:
INSERT INTO `c_reg_users` VALUES ('blabla', '', '47e014ee34869ded7e5236541246319d', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'WorldWideWeb', '', 'bla@...', '0', 'user', '', 1130763311, '80.96.72.233', '1', 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', './images/avatars/def_avatar.gif');
3. Then copy all your new reg lines into plus/instalation/mysql.sql, in the according section of that file (there should be as many lines with INSERT INTO as your registered users number. If you migrate, you should delete the admin account line from mysql.sql, but let the plusbot account unaltered at this point!). It is also a good opportunity to promote your users to admin (just replace the value of desired user to be promoted, from 'moderator' or 'user' to 'admin')
4. Then follow the plus/docs/Instructions.txt

3Q.
The installation process is so complicated for me...
3A.
Well, my personal record time for a full instalation including upload of the new files, migration of the old users to Plus, fully adding the bot and addition of all the extrasounds for /buzz command is 28 minutes (the time between the user contacted me on Yahoo Messenger and the moment I said "All done!"); this hapenned on a brand new site for me (I also had to ask for cpanel details and so on, so the effective time consumed for installation was like 20 minutes). If you don't believe me, ask kay_s_ok@yahoo.com. She will confirm this.
So it is not actually too complicated, but requires some knowledge of mysql and ftp. How could an website admin have no clue about this? That's his problem, I guess...

4Q.
I run phpMyChat-Plus and I set up to have only a single public room. But there are some (0) 's displayed on my rooms list in the chat. How can I remove them?
4A.
If you personalize the rooms names and also the number of rooms, it is not enough to do it in the configuration tab of admin panel. It also requires a 2 lines editting in config/config.lib.php as follows:
Open config/config.lib.php and look for these lines:
$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM1, ROOM2, ROOM3, ROOM4, ROOM5);
$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM6, ROOM7, ROOM8, ROOM9);
This is the default layout and number of the rooms available in the chat.
Now, comment out the original lines and add the modified ones, as you like:
//$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM1, ROOM2, ROOM3, ROOM4, ROOM5);
//$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM6, ROOM7, ROOM8, ROOM9);
$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM1);
$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM2, ROOM3);
Please note that ROOM1 means it will use the skin number one, and so on. I would recommend you choose your desired skins first (visiting everyroom - public and private - if you already disabled them, use this testing server: http://plus.gamedogs.com and take a look at the styles used for each room). Then you use those corresponding numbers in the room definitions of your config.lib.php. For example, I will choose style 3 for the public room and 2 and 6 for the private rooms
$DefaultChatRooms = array(ROOM3);
$DefaultPrivateRooms = array(ROOM2, ROOM6);

5Q.
How do I avoid being booted from a chat after the time set for booting?
5A.
An admin and a moderator should never be booted. If that happens, it means your browser lost the connection with the server somehow.
For an user to stay logged even though he don't type for a while, he can go away using /away command (away users don't get booted)
