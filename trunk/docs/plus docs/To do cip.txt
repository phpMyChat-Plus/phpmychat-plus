Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: One quick question if you have time?
Ciprian Murariu: yes please
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: I want to allow permissions for certain rooms without them having to "sign in"  and keep people out of them that aren’t supposed to be there.  Is that possible?
Ciprian Murariu: i don’t understand
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: Okay, say I want to make room three where only certain people can get in it, I don’t want them to have to have a special password, but just be approved for there.  It would be something I would have to "allow" as an admin.
Ciprian Murariu: well, that’s not possible as it is
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: hmm
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: okay so I just set up a room and put a password on it then?
Ciprian Murariu: how would you do that?
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: I don’t know that is what I am asking
Ciprian Murariu: hmmm
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: could we write a code in the styles, like "get permission" for a certain room?
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: where it would show up on the admin cp?
Ciprian Murariu: some extra code will certanly be necesar to have this happen
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: thats what I figured.  It’s kinda important for this particular chat facility
Ciprian Murariu: well, it seems a nice mod, but i need time to develop it
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: okay let me know what you come up with?
Suzzanne Carlson - phpMyChat: I appreciate it very much
Ciprian Murariu: ok, no problem
