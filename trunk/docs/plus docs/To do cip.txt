Requests / Suggestions

-boot/kick from admin panel
-runCMD - to return the old M content after using a click (command) - Ciprian
-Statistics mod - Mei Yung - ?
-add the members page/profiles - Ciprian
-credits page - Ciprian
-/ghost command: put the user into a ghost state (the ghost user and his posts cannot be seen in the room, he won’t know about this, so he gives up and leave the chat - works when banning has no effect on a specific user; it also allows an admin/moder to go invisible in the chat); - Ciprian
-commands table & archiving/logging the commands used in chat as well - Ciprian
-cookie handler - to delete the old cookies automatically on new installs/upgrades and to remove the old room names on panel changes - Ciprian
-automatically delete cookies after upgrade on each client machine - Ciprian (not sure yet how to do this - how can we check if a user is first time loading the page?)
-fix the enable/disable sound command and add the option in the right menu in chat, not just in users_popup - Ciprian
-coming back from avatar picker loses the previous values in profile - parsing - I think of changing the avatar page into a simple select list, with image preview - Ciprian
-upgrade as many localizations from std - Ciprian - ongoing
-add the gallery feature (not sure if useful/reliable, as the hosting space/size is variable and can be limited for many users) - Ciprian
-cell right align in chat (for right-to-left languages); also some display order fixes needed - I will adjust all these as it goes, but mainly when a right-to-left language will be translated - Ciprian

I want to allow permissions for certain rooms without them having to "sign in"  and keep people out of them that aren’t supposed to be there.  Is that possible? Say I want to make room three where only certain people can get in it, I don’t want them to have to have a special password, but just be approved for there.  It would be something I would have to "allow" as an admin.
Could we write a code in the styles, like "get permission" for a certain room? Where it would show up on the admin cp?
