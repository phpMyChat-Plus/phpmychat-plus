Instructions for a NEW installation (or an UPGRADE) of the Plus version you just downloaded.
Note: This version comes with a fully automated wizard to help you install phpMyChat Plus on your site.
Alternatively a manual install folder. If you choose the manual installation, please read the step 7 then go to manual install folder and follow those instructions..

1. Extract plus.zip

2. Upload the plus directory into your public_html folder.
Note: index.php must be in the plus folder, not plus/chat/ as for the previous versions.
The file index1.php is the index file with the full page filled. Choose the one you want and keep it as index.php.

3. Optionally, rename plus folder to whatever you'd like (chat, mychat).

4. Open http://yoursiteurl.com/plus  (plus is the name you used in step 3.). The setup will load automatically.

5. Pick up an available language and go through the installer (thanks to Thomas Pschernig and Ciprian).

6. Make sure the file install/install.php is deleted from your chat, otherwise you won't be able to open the chat login page.

7. Test your site functionality by opening http://yoursiteurl.com/plus (plus is the name you used in step 3.) in your browser. Note that there is only one admin right now: the one defines suring setup.

8. Open the Administration menu/link (Admin Panel) and customize your chat (do not rename your bot yet).

That's it! It should fly!


After install Support

A: If you don't intend to use the bot, edit the quick menu in admin config panel to eliminate the bot commands from the quick list.
If bot answers you (posts any content) then you can change it's name in Admin Panel now - it's safe.
This version comes only with the English and German files.
To add other languages by yourself, edit all the other languages you want but english from the standard pack and add them in chat/localization/.
Insert, modify and translate according to the new lines added in english version (use a text compare software).

B: If you get into troubles with bot, you need to uninstall and reinstall it to make it work again:
B1. Stop the bot in chat rooms it is started in, using the /bot stop command (if it doesn't work, just delete the bot records in c_users table - with phpmyadmin - and botfb folder).
B2. Rename the bot to "plusbot" in Admin panel.
B3. Use phpmyadmin to "empty" the following tables: bot_bot, bot_bots, bot_patterns and bot_templates.
B4. Reupload back (restore) the file called botloader.php (or botloadrinc.php, if first frozes).
B5. Make sure all the original distributed files are in the aiml folder (startup.xml and *.aiml files).
B6. Make sure the plus/bot/subs.inc file is chmoded to 777 (step 5 in this tutorial).
B7. Reinstall the bot following the steps described in paragraph A. (A1-A8)

C. This chat comes with 10 different skins (config/style1-10.css.php) Play with them and decide which ones fits best your site style. To do that, use a temporary/backup folder where you can rename them one by one to style1.css.php then upload them (again, one by one) into the config folder. Login to first default room, take a look, when you're done, logout and do the same with the next style. And so on. At the end, reupload the original style1.css.php.
After you discovered how all the skins look like, just rename them to match the room number (1-5 are for the first 5 public rooms, in order; 6-9 are the first 4 private rooms, in order - all 9 are defined and enabled by default in admin panel; 10th skin is unused by default)

For more instructions (e.g. how to upgrade the c_reg_users table) read the Plus FAQ.txt in the "docs/plus docs" folder. Actually, read also the Fixes readme.txt which might give you some more hints about new features/fixes and other stuff.
That's all for now! Have a nice one and let me know how it goes!

Do you need some more tries of different configurations before applying to your chat server? Don't hesitate to use the Demo/Try me server at http://ciprianmp.com/latest/ or http://plus.gamedogs.com (use admin/admin or moderator/moderator as login for different powers - not registration required)
